# Squad-Up

Squad Up is an app that is designed to help gamers connect with other gamers, especially during the pandemic. They can connect by searching for people or groups with the same interests as them. Once connected, they can chat, either individually or in a group, and share information to connect and play in the game. There is also a watch party feature for people who prefer to watch videos or live streams of games rather than play them (either because they like it more or donâ€™t have the ability to play). A watch party will allow everyone in that lobby to watch the same video or live stream at the same time and chat about it. They can also make posts on specific games to share their opinion or find other users.
